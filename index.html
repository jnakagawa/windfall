		The basic details of the dataset can be seen above. SQL queries and such can be seen by clicking on the frame.
		Since HELOC's are lines of credit made on existing home equity, it wouldn't make sense for the HELOC to be made to pay for a home. 
		The max number of bedroom's might be a bit eye-popping, but it's because the record belongs to an entire housing condiminium of over 200,000 SQ Ft.

		<p>We can see that over all properties, % of a property's value paid down generally increased until it peaks in 2011 and then declines after that. From doing a bit of research, 2011 is the year that housing prices bottomed out post-crash in most places, making it a good time to buy. With lower home prices, a down payment will take up a greater proportion of a property's value.

		Slicing deeper by property types, we see that Single Family Residences are most stable, hovering around 33% down payment for the whole time period.
		Vacant land takes the highest % paid down, but also fluctuates greatly. This is probably because our sample size for lots and duplexes is so small, so small that we can't really comment on any trends we see within the data for these property types.
		For Condos, however, we do see a small peak in 2011.</p>
 		<p>
		Slicing by price bracket, we can see that as expected, cheapest properties have the largest proportion paid down, typically 100%.
		The price bracket with the lowest percentage paid down is the 100-500K bracket, which is also the largest bracket.
		Two notable upwards trends can be seen in the 10k-50k and 50k-100k brackets.
		The 5MIL+ bracket doesn't have much data, but we can see a lot of properties being bought entirely without loans(or minimal loans) which is pretty incredible with the exceptions being in 2011 and 2008
		</p>
		<p>
		With bed+bath(this yielded the most useful data) we can see that 5-7 bed/baths has the lowest % paid down.
		We see the same 2011 spike in 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5 bed+bath brackets, but not so much in the very large 5-7 bracket. Any other trends are hard to tease out of this data.

		The only inferences I can see here are that entities buying properties from 10k-100k had more significantly more cash on hand every year to buy properties, since I'm assuming that someone will make the maximum down payment they can afford. Another possibility is that homes were getting cheaper, but this isn't really true, looking at the median home sale prices there was a big dip in 2008 housing crash but otherwise home prices are always increasing.
		Would be interesting to do some more research on what made 2011 an inflection point in the market in Denver.

			Right away, we can see that there is a peak in % of properties with HELOC for properties with 6 Bedrooms, dropping off with an almost normal distribution on either side of that.

			Since there is sparser data for larger properties, we see a couple of large spikes, but we can't really read into these since they are usually the result of one or two records of a HELOC for a Condo
		</p>
		<p>
			Slicing by property type, HELOCS for single family residences are most common, followed by condos.
			Slicing by home price bracket, we see that the most HELOCs are most popular for 1MIL-5MIL properties, followed by 500K to 1MIL properties.
			Properties under 10k don't seem to have a HELOC which makes sense since at that level, the amount of equity in a home isn't much more than a typical credit card credit line, making a HELOC impractical. Interesting to note, however, that the next lowest bracket is the 5MIL+ bracket. Just conjecture here, but I imagine that for an individual who can afford to pay 5MIL+ for a home doesn't really need a loan to buy other things.


			Looking at our median HELOC value wrt home sale price, I rounded home sale prices to the nearest 10K for homes under 1MIL and to the nearest 100k for homes over and then aggregated by median.
			 We see a steady linear increase up until about 2MIL, when the data gets erratic. This makes sense. For a greater value home, you would want to take out a larger line of credit. Looking deeper into this, we see an interesting trend:
			Lower value properties also seem to have larger HELOCs with respect to their home price, with the relative size decreasing until about 300K. After this, the value steadies out at around 25% of the home value until things get erratic around the 1.5MIL mark.
		</p>
		The average time passing before a HELOC is issued is nearly 8 years. This makes sense since, at this point, a fair amount of equity is built up in the home for an individual to borrow against. There is however, a very large spread with a Standard Deviation of around 7.5 years. We see HELOCs issued the same day as the home itself (this seems strange) and HELOCs issued 46 years after the home sale. I left out data points where HELOCS seemed to be issued before the Home Sale since apparently this is due to incomplete records
